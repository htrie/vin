					   example, consider a resource that was used as a read-only Texture and then written to as a RenderTarget. It is assumed that this was done without
					   using appropriate synchronization first - specifically, without invalidating the GPU's texture cache. When using a ResourceBarrier
					   to convert the RenderTarget back to a Texture, the  CB cache of the GPU will always be flushed and invalidated. In this case, however,
					   the stale data in the "destination" cache (the texture cache) must also be invalidated.
				@param enable Pass <c>true</c> to enable destination cache flush/invalidate.
				@note The "invalidate" operation here is usually implemented as a "flush and invalidate". This would not be correct if the "destination"
				      cache contains dirty data that hasn't been written back to memory yet. The only way to correct this scenario would be to perform
					  the appropriate synchronization in the first place.
				@note A ResourceBarrier will always flush and invalidate the caches for the "old" resource usage; this function controls only whether
				      the "new" usage caches will be invalidated, as well.
