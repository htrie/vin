Vin - VI Normalized - Vulkan streamlined text editor

My own attempt at a smaller vim, with:
- only my commonly used bindings are supported
- sometimes simpler bindings (gg becomes g, since no other g commands supported)
- space-based action menu (replaces command mode altogether since much more limited)
- Vulkan rendering
- Windows-only (Unix line endings only though)
- no cursor support
- no syntax highlighting, just HSV word highlighting
- no splits, windows and bars
