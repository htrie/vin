Vin - VI Normalized - Vulkan streamlined text editor

My own attempt at a smaller vim:
- only my commonly used bindings are supported
- sometimes simpler bindings (gg becomes g, since no other g commands supported)
- space-based action menu (replaces command mode altogether since much more limited)
- Vulkan batched rendering
- Windows-only (Unix line endings only though, CR displayed but as any other character)
- no mouse support
- trivial "syntax" highlighting (no LSP or tree-sitter)
- no split support
